# Guided LLM CLI

A framework for creating guided command-line interfaces that facilitate structured interactions between users, deterministic scripts, and non-deterministic language models. This project aims to streamline the development of CLI tools that leverage the power of LLMs while providing a consistent and intuitive user experience.

Key features:

- Rapid development of guided CLI workflows
- Seamless integration of deterministic logic and LLM capabilities
- Flexible state management and command sequencing
- Consistent error handling and user feedback
